### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my slice of world. 
I am a hands-on engineer interested in many curious stuff including deep learning, and especially: 
* Graph neural nets because graphs are flexible, powerful, and naturally emerge as the go-to representation tool in a variety of scenarii.
* Physics-informed ML that ensure fundamental physics properties are captured by the neural model.
Most of the public code reflects the efforts I've dedicated to exploring exciting tech the hard way - dev quality no more.
